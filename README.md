## Inspiration
In the trying times of 2020, one may feel overwhelmed with a sense of dread following the lack of activities to pass the time. So the solution that came to our minds was a to-do list. However, unlike traditional lists, activities are pre-filled, lessening the load and stress on the the mind of the user. This list of pre-selected tasks are carefully curated to enhance their stay-home experience and be more productive, social, and overall more fulfilled than usual. Why lists? 
### Reason 1: 
The “Zeigarnik Effect”: A psychological phenomenon that describes the tendency of individuals to remember incomplete tasks more than completed tasks, enabling memory retention. Tasks will be on your mind, making it more likely that you complete them. This leads to increased productivity in your stay-home.

### Reason 2:
Anxiety Reducing: Unorganized tasks can feel overwhelming. Lists provide concrete structure, something that is comforting to us during this time of turmoil. The act of creating a list is one of commitment, increasing the likelihood of that the tasks being completed.

### Reason 3:
Satisfaction: As one crosses things off their list, the satisfaction of completing that task only further motivates them This reinforcement creates a positive psychological process.


## What it does:
	Instead of making users add elements to a list to do, this website gives the user a group  of pre-selected tasks in order to enhance their stay-home experience and be more productive, social, and overall more fulfilled than usual. As quarantine feels like it ceases to end, and the days all seem to blend in together, a simple list composed of healthy habits can be beneficial for one’s health. Either way, eating a cutie can never be a bad thing!





## How I built it
	HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used to make this website.Github Pages was the host.
	Hard work, dedication, and Kim.
## Challenges I ran into
	Learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the first time was rough, and sorting out bugs with the list itself turned out to be quite challenging. This reduced our time so the scope of our project was lessened.
## Accomplishments that I am proud of
	We are proud that we have finished a project in under 12 hours, a first for us. As this is  our first hackathon, finishing a project in 12 hours or less seemed impossible, but learning proper communication and teamwork allowed us to realize this is possible, and even fun.

## What I learned
Dylan:
This hackathon taught me how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make a cool little website. This was a very valuable experience to have, as it taught me and the other members of the team to both learn how to use effective collaboration and have fun with coding.

Kim:
Through this hackathon, I learned how to put art into HTML. In addition, academic wise, through research in this project, I learned the psychology behind list making and how it is beneficial to one's health.

Jakin:
I learned better how to use html, javascript, and css as a unit and how they worked together as well as the functionality of Github pages. In addition I learned how to collaborate more effectively as a group and honed my communication skills.

## What’s next for stay at home
	Adding minigames with the cuties you collected to plant the tree. Examples would be as you walk to plant the trees, you could run into some random events/encounters that lead into some varied minigames.
