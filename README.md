## Why Lists?

Instead of making users add elements to a list to do, this website gives the user a group of pre-selected tasks in order to enhance their stay-home experience and be more productive, social, and overall more fulfilled than usual.

### Reason 1: 
The “Zeigarnik Effect”: A psychological phenomenon that describes the tendency of individuals to remember incomplete tasks more than completed tasks, enabling memory retention. Tasks will be on your mind, making it more likely that you complete them. This leads to increased productivity in your stay-home.

### Reason 2: 
Anxiety Reducing: Unorganized tasks can feel overwhelming. Lists provide concrete structure, something that is comforting to us during this time of turmoil. The act of creating a list is one of commitment, increasing the likelihood of that the tasks being completed.

### Reason 3: 
Satisfaction: As one crosses things off their list, the satisfaction of completing that task only further motivates them  This reinforcement creates a positive psychological process.

As quarantine feels like it ceases to end, and the days all seem to blend in together, a simple list composed of healthy habits can be beneficial for one’s health. Either way, eating a cutie can never be a bad thing!
